"""vlspeed-prestage: stage the disk-backed Engram rows before the forward.

An on-disk Engram table is read by the CPU, so `prepare_embeddings` puts a
host round trip inside the model forward and the forward cannot be captured
in a CUDA graph. Our engram.py already refuses capture with that message and
already carries the seam its docstring describes: `ParallelEngramEmbedding
.prefetch(ids)` starts a read that a later `lookup` for exactly those ids
takes without reading again. It says no caller exists. This adds one.

`EngramDiskStager.stage()` runs from the V2 model state's `prepare_inputs`,
outside the forward. It runs the same `NgramHashState` the forward runs, on
the same step inputs, submits both engram layers' reads (each layer has its
own table and its own reader pool, so the two overlap), then lands the rows
in each layer's persistent `staged_rows`. `prepare_embeddings` then only has
to not undo it, so the forward holds no host call and captures.

Design taken from tonyd2wild/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-vLLM-DGX-Spark fix 8
(patch/cudagraph-prestage). The model_state.py wiring is theirs. The stager
body is ours, because our disk reader is not theirs: ours is one interleaved
row file per layer per rank with O_DIRECT and its own worker set, addressed
by global row id, so `gather_dequant_many`, `disk_rel_owned` and the pinned
staging buffers their version needs have no counterpart here.

VL41_ENGRAM_PRESTAGE_VERIFY=N makes `prepare_embeddings` redo the lookup and
compare bitwise against the staged rows for the first N calls, then turn
itself off and say so, so one eager boot gives both the proof and a clean
benchmark. Eager only: under capture this would be the host call the whole
patch exists to remove, and it raises there.

Applies to an installed vLLM tree; pass the dist-packages/vllm path.
